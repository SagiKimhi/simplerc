# SimpleRC - A Simple Resource Management Package in Python

## General:
Small general lightweight package for sharing and managing resources.
Not sure for how long development will continue on this package,
this is just useful for me for the time being and I like to share
so hopefuly this will be helpful for others as well.

## Regarding license and legal stuff: 
The formal license is Apache Version 2.0
The non-formal license is I couldn't care less about legal stuff

As long as it doesnt hurt me or others in anyway, use this as you please,
License is simply there so that it can also be useful for commercial use.

I'm not using any external packages or dependencies other then Python
built-in modules both to keep my head, email, and repo clean, as well as
to allow myself and others to use it for whatever reason or need.

## Regarding Development
As of writing this, this is just a simple utility and im not planning
to continue development currently on a daily/weekly and can't tell whether
or not I will forget about this and when.

In any case, as long as no security issues are found, I don't think its an
issue.
There really isn't nothing much here and I don't see how it can break even
w/o me working on it in the future (
    Yes I can hear the future me yelling and regretting that last sentence,
    but thats future me sc**w that dude. Thats the model - I break and make
    big mess, future fix and make all pretty and makes sure to leave some
    mess for his future to handle.
)

## Even though development may be minimal (Regarding Issues and pull requests)
In any case, Issues and additions are welcome.
Furthermore, if it is a security issue, bug, an elegant optimization,
or even just a better more correct way of doing things, please share
it and create an issue/pull request.

In other words, as long as its not some sort of 'BRUHHHH NOT WORKING PLEASE
FIX NEED HELP CUZ CANT USE STACKOVERFLOW CUZ BLOCKED FOR NO REASON',
then feel free to post it.

I haven't defined a format for requests/issues (and probably never will) in
order to keep discussions open and encourage contributions and involvement
of the community.

If you implemented something, fixed something, found a meaningfull bug/issue,
simplified, cleaned, optimized, organized, or did anything else that can help
and/or educate myself and others, I appreciate it.

If I haven't merged your pull request, its not necessarily because i don't
think I should, but most likely because I haven't  seen it or because I can't
understand it yet (won't put something I can't understand in a codebase myself
and others use and risk breaking other people's code unless I truly trust
you and your skillset), or because I love it but simply think it is too
complex for such simple lightweight package, or to complex for me to keep
maintaining in the future if this pkg turns out to actually be useful.

If it is the last described scenario ill probably also recommend creating
a seperate repo and adding a recommendation for it directly in mine.
Further more, if it truly is useful and elegant but simply not something I 
can maintain myself, ill be happy to add it as an optional dependency in
addition to the recommendation (went kinda far thinking this package will
even reach or help anyone in the future, huh, I wonder...)
